This reverse array challenge was to take an array and reverse the order of the numbers without using the built-in reverse method.

the white board for this one is conceptually simple. make {1,2,3} into {3,2,1}

the concept is to loop through the original array and populate a new empty array by using a counter and looping backwards. Then joinging everything by a comma and writing as a string.
